DOCUMENTATION FOR NEWPRJ.EXE

newprj was created by Anthony Andersen. Compuserve ID 72037,2474.
I wrote this to simplify the tedious task of creating a new set of
OS/2 PM project files. If it helps anyone else, I'm happy.

You need an OS/2 toolkit (or SKD or SoftSet) and MS C 5.1 or higher to 
compile the new project. I have tested it with versions 1.1 and 1.2.

The source code and the executable file have been released into the 
public domain. Any comments about newprj are welcome.

newprj creates a new OS/2 PM project. It's a pretty simple program. You run 
it by typing:

	newprj projname

where projname is the name of the new project. 

newprj creates eight files: 
	.MAK - MS MAKE file, 
	.C   - C source file, 
	.H   - C header file,
	.LNK - linker command file, 
	.DEF - linker definition file, 
	.RC  - resource compiler file.
	.ICO - icon file, and 
	.DLG - resource compiler dialog file, 

this is a listing of the files created by typing:

	newprj slash

SLASH    MAK      284   3-15-90   1:28a
SLASH    C       5509   3-15-90   1:28a
SLASH    DEF      159   3-15-90   1:28a
SLASH    LNK       68   3-15-90   1:28a
SLASH    H        684   3-15-90   1:28a
SLASH    DLG      757   3-15-90   1:28a
SLASH    ICO      288   3-15-90   1:28a
SLASH    RC      1469   3-15-90   1:28a


Once you've run newprj, you can compile the new project by typing:

	make projname.mak

This will create an EXE file which will run (although it really doesn't
do anything).
